# Solana Verifiable Build CLI

## Installation

In order for this CLI to work properly, you must have `docker` installed on your computer. Follow the steps here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ to install Docker (based on your platform)

Once the installation is complete, make sure that the server has been started: (https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/start/)

To install the verifier cli, run the following in your shell:

```
bash <(curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ellipsis-Labs/solana-verifiable-build/master/verifier-cli-install.sh)
```

## Example Walkthrough

After installing the CLI, we can test the program verification against the following immutable mainnet program: `2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn`

Check it out here: https://solana.fm/address/2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn?cluster=mainnet-qn1

### Verification with Docker

Run the following command:

```
verifier-cli verify-from-image -e examples/hello_world/target/deploy/hello_world.so -i ellipsislabs/hello_world_verifiable_build:latest -p 2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn
```

This the output:

```
Verifying image: "ellipsislabs/hello_world_verifiable_build:latest", on network "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com" against program ID 2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn
Executable path in container: "examples/hello_world/target/deploy/hello_world.so"

Executable matches on-chain program data âœ…
```

This command loads up the image stored at [ellipsislabs/hello_world_verifiable_build:latest](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ellipsislabs/hello_world_verifiable_build/latest/images/sha256-d8b51c04c739999da618df4271d8d088fdcb3a0d8474044ebf434ebb993b5c7d?context=explore), and verifies that the hash of the executable path in the container is the same as the hash of the on-chain program supplied to the command. Because the build was already uploaded to an image, there is no need for a full rebuild of the executable which takes an extremely long time.

### Manual Verification

To get the hash of the of this program, we can run the following:

```
verifier-cli get-program-hash -p 2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn
```

Which will return the following hash:

```
627a5b29a06179d08ac5eab2c085703e59decbe6
```

By default, this command will strip any trailing zeros away from the program executable file and run the sha1 algorithm against it to compute the hash.


To manually verify this build, one could run the following from the root of this repository. _This command takes a long time because it is building the binary in a Docker container_

```
cd examples/hello_world
verifier-cli build

```

Now we can check the resulting hash from the build.

```
verifier-cli get-executable-hash -f target/deploy/hello_world.so

```

This will return the hash of the stripped executable

```
