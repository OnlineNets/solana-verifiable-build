# Solana Verify CLI

A command line tool to build and verify solana programs. Users can ensure that the hash of the on-chain program matches the hash of the program of the given codebase. 

## Installation

In order for this CLI to work properly, you must have `docker` installed on your computer. Follow the steps here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ to install Docker (based on your platform)

Once the installation is complete, make sure that the server has been started: (https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/start/)

To install the Solana Verify cli, run the following in your shell:

```
bash <(curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ellipsis-Labs/solana-verifiable-build/master/verifier-cli-install.sh)
```

## Example Walkthrough

After installing the CLI, we can test the program verification against the following immutable mainnet program: `2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn`

Check it out here: https://solana.fm/address/2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn?cluster=mainnet-qn1

### Verification with Docker

Run the following command:

```
solana-verify verify-from-image -e examples/hello_world/target/deploy/hello_world.so -i ellipsislabs/hello_world_verifiable_build:latest -p 2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn
```

This command loads up the image stored at [ellipsislabs/hello_world_verifiable_build:latest](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ellipsislabs/hello_world_verifiable_build/latest/images/sha256-d8b51c04c739999da618df4271d8d088fdcb3a0d8474044ebf434ebb993b5c7d?context=explore), and verifies that the hash of the executable path in the container is the same as the hash of the on-chain program supplied to the command. Because the build was already uploaded to an image, there is no need for a full rebuild of the executable which takes an extremely long time.

The Dockerfile that creates the image `ellipsislabs/hello_world_verifiable_build:latest` can be found in ./examples/hello_world under this repo.

Below is the expected output:

```
Verifying image: "ellipsislabs/hello_world_verifiable_build:latest", on network "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com" against program ID 2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn
Executable path in container: "examples/hello_world/target/deploy/hello_world.so"

Executable hash: 08d91368d349c2b56c712422f6d274a1e8f1946ff2ecd1dc3efc3ebace52a760
Program hash: 08d91368d349c2b56c712422f6d274a1e8f1946ff2ecd1dc3efc3ebace52a760
Executable matches on-chain program data âœ…
```

### Manual Verification

To get the hash of an on-chain program, we can run the following with a given program ID:

```
solana-verify get-program-hash 2ZrriTQSVekoj414Ynysd48jyn4AX6ZF4TTJRqHfbJfn
```

Which will return the following hash:

```
08d91368d349c2b56c712422f6d274a1e8f1946ff2ecd1dc3efc3ebace52a760
```

By default, this command will strip any trailing zeros away from the program executable and run the sha256 algorithm against it to compute the hash.

To manually verify this program, one could run the following from the root of this repository, which builds a program from source code and computes a hash. _This command takes a long time because it is building the binary in a Docker container_

```
solana-verify build $PWD/examples/hello_world

```

Now we can check the resulting hash from the build.

```
solana-verify get-executable-hash ./examples/hello_world/target/deploy/hello_world.so

```

This will return the hash of the stripped executable, which should match the hash of the program data retrieved from the blockchain.
